# SQL Database Chat Assistant ðŸ’¬
This project is a Streamlit web application designed to assist users with their SQL queries using a conversational chatbot interface. The chatbot is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model and can connect to both SQLite and MySQL databases to assist with a variety of database-related tasks and queries.
